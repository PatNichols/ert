These use 3 different algorithms to interpolate the given data
1) Nearest neighbor : find n (default = 1) nearest neighbors to
	 the interpolated point and assign the same value.
2) Shephard: use a inverse weighted method
3) Similar to Shephard but uses weights to insure that the interpolation
   will reproduce values at sample points.

Instruction for use 

1) type make
2) ./rbf && gnuplot -persist < rbf_plt.sh > rbf.png

repeat  step 2 for shep and nn
